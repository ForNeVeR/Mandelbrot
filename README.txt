Mandelbrot is program for real-time visualizing Mandelbrot set. Points are
drawn with various colors according to 'depth' (how many iterations taken to
determine that point is NOT part of Mandelbrot set). If point really IS part of
set, it will be drawn with black color.

STARTING PROGRAM

> Mandelbrot W H
run program in windowed mode with window size W x H.

> Mandelbrot --full
run program in fullscreen mode.

> Mandelbrot
will run program windowed with default window size (this mode also will be used
in case of some problems).

Please note that running with big window size or fullscreen takes many system
resources.
